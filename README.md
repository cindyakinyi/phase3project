# 📘 Customer Churn Prediction Project

## 📊 Overview
This project uses **machine learning models** to predict **customer churn** — identifying customers likely to leave a telecom service.  
The goal is to help companies develop **data-driven retention strategies**.

---

## 🧠 Objectives
- Understand key factors influencing churn.  
- Build and evaluate classification models.  
- Provide actionable insights for business improvement.  

---

## 🧹 Data Preparation
- Cleaned and encoded categorical variables.  
- Handled missing values.  
- Split data into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets.  
- Scaled numeric features where necessary.  

---

## 🤖 Machine Learning Models
- **Decision Tree Classifier:** Tuned using GridSearchCV.  
  - Accuracy: ~97%  
- **Logistic Regression:** Used as baseline.  
  - Accuracy: ~86%  

---

## 🔍 Key Insights
- High day-minute usage and frequent customer service calls increase churn risk.  
- Customers with international plans churn more often.  
- Decision Tree captured complex behavior patterns better than Logistic Regression.

---

## 🚀 Recommendations
- Focus retention on high-usage, high-call customers.  
- Improve service quality and plan flexibility.  
- Use advanced resampling (SMOTE) to balance future datasets.
